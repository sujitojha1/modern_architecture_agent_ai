    "chunk": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa, and the West Indies. While traditionally, cricket has largely been played by men, Women's cricket has experienced large growth in the 21st century. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won eight One Day International trophies, including six World Cups, more than any other country, and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country. And that really is amazing!",

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this",

The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]",

For example, DLF has a battery buy-back policy. - DLF has established dedicated waste collection areas and waste separation facilities at its managed sites. Solid waste undergoes segregation in specific assigned areas, where it is directed for reuse, recycling, or energy recovery, depending on the type of waste. Three types of waste are segregated and monitored as mentioned below: a. Green Bin: Biodegradable organic waste such as food waste. Wet waste collected through these bins, is transferred to organic waste composters installed on-site for composting. The manure generated from this process is used as a fertilizer for horticulture purpose in landscaping. b. Blue Bin: Other non-hazardous recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, metal waste. This dry waste is further directed for reuse, recycling through authorised vendors or sent to waste-to-energy plants. c. Black Bin: Hazardous waste items such as sanitary waste and e-waste. The e-waste and hazardous waste like used lube oil and batteries are safely disposed through Government authorized vendors, in line with regulatory requirements.

These emergencies are identified as natural disasters and human caused disasters such as fire incidents, gas leakage, earthquake, flood, cyclone, power blackout, terrorist attacks, bomb threats, civil unrest, food poisoning and epidemics. The Company\u2019s ERPP is designed with the following broad objectives: - To assist facilities and project sites to respond to and manage emergencies in an orderly manner; To establish a robust system for notification and escalation of an emergency to appropriate levels for emergency response measures; and - To provide resolution of an incident and minimise implications for the stakeholders arising from initial and subsequent events. Following are important features of the ERPP which help ensure safety and business continuity: - Dedicated emergency response team is available at all managed sites to address such situations and minimize any adverse impacts; - ISO 45001 aligned Safety Management System has been implemented at all managed assets and disaster management system adopted for all rental and construction sites; - Periodic emergency preparedness training and awareness generation is carried out for all employees; Robust fire safety management systems in all buildings (including early warning fire detection, automatic sprinkler system, fire suppression systems etc.); - All real estate projects are developed one level above seismic zone requirements to enhance building safety in case of earthquakes. Additionally, rainwater harvesting wells have been built to prevent flooding at site; 42 - At all construction sites, common assembly points and maps at various places have been set up, so that in case of any emergency all the engaged workers can gather immediately at the assembly point; and - Safety team is available at all construction sites for monitoring and assuring that there are no lapses in any of the safety measures. 8. \u0007Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity.

A large percentage of emissions generated by the real estate sector arise from the value chain, including production of construction materials. However, in FY 2022-23, there has been no significant adverse impacts to the environment arising from any of the DLF\u2019s projects. The Company promotes responsible development practices through ensuring compliance to all applicable regulatory requirements, incorporating climate resilient building design in its portfolio, promoting the use of renewables for energy generation and procuring sustainable construction material.

    "chunk": "**SEBI's Investigation into Gensol Engineering** The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has issued an interim order against Gensol Engineering and its promoters, Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi, citing serious financial misconduct. The investigation revealed that funds intended for electric vehicle procurement were diverted to purchase a \u20b943 crore luxury apartment in DLF's \"The Camellias\" project in Gurugram.\ue206 **Key Findings:** - **Diversion of Funds:** SEBI traced \u20b942.94 crore from Capbridge Ventures LLP, where both Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi are designated partners, to a payment made to DLF. The apartment was initially booked in the name of the promoters' mother, Jasminder Kaur, with a \u20b95 crore advance, which was later refunded and replaced by Capbridge as the final buyer.\ue206 - **Layered Transactions:** The funds originated from Gensol, passed through its vendor Go-Auto and related entities, before reaching DLF. The \u20b95 crore booking advance was sourced from Gensol\u2019s funds via multiple related parties and, once refunded by DLF, rerouted to another related entity\u2014Matrix Gas and Renewables. SEBI stated that these transactions demonstrate layered fund flows to disguise personal asset acquisition using public company funds.\ue206 - **Broader Financial Misconduct:** Gensol borrowed over \u20b9977 crore from institutions like IREDA and PFC for procuring 6,400 electric vehicles but acquired only 4,704, costing \u20b9567.73 crore. Nearly \u20b9262 crore remains unaccounted for, allegedly misappropriated through Go-Auto and channeled to multiple promoter-related entities.\ue206 - **Corporate Governance Failures:** SEBI noted a complete breakdown of corporate governance at Gensol, with promoters using the company\u2019s resources for personal expenses, including purchasing luxury real estate and engaging in speculative trading in Gensol\u2019s own shares via Wellray Solar.\ue206 **Regulatory Actions:** - SEBI has barred Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi from acting as directors or key managerial personnel in Gensol and prohibited them, along with Gensol, from trading in the securities market.\ue206 - A planned 1:10 stock split has been frozen to protect investors.\ue206 - A forensic audit has been ordered to examine financial records of Gensol and its related entities.\ue206 - SEBI also cited misleading disclosures by Gensol, including exaggerated claims of EV orders and strategic tie-ups, none of which were backed by binding contracts or financial rationale.\ue206 SEBI has warned retail investors to exercise caution, especially in light of the potential for promoters to offload remaining stakes and erode value further.\ue206 --- For the full article and more detailed information, you can visit the original source: \ue200link\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",

SEBI received a complaint in June 2024, relating to manipulation of share price and diversion of funds from GEL and thereafter, started examining the matter. **Recent Developments** 11. Credit Rating Agencies, CARE Rating Limited (CARE) and ICRA Limited (ICRA) on March 03, 2025, and March 04, 2025, respectively, downgraded the ratings assigned by them for fund-based and non-fund based credit facilities availed by the Company, to \u201cD\u201d as delays in servicing debt obligations. 12. The rationale for the downgrade as per the press release issued by ICRA is extracted below: *\u201cThe ratings for the bank facilities of Gensol Engineering Limited (GEL) have been* *downgraded to [ICRA]D following* ***feedback received by ICRA from the company*** ***\u2019*** ***s*** ***lenders about the ongo*** ***in*** ***g delays in debt servicing*** *. GEL, in its latest public* *disclosures as well as in its recent communications with ICRA, had highlighted sizeable* *available liquidity to support its operations during its ongoing growth phase.\u201d* ### 13. ICRA, in its statement also disclosed that \u201c certain documents shared by GEL ***with ICRA, on its debt s e r vicing track record, were apparently falsified,*** *which raises concerns on its corporate governance practices, including its * *liquidity position.\u201d * 14. On March 05, 2024, Gensol issued an investor release through the stock exchange platform, signed by its CEO, Anmol Singh Jaggi, wherein the Company categorically denied \u201cany involvement in falsification claims\u201d made by the rating agency. 15. SEBI called for information from the CRAs regarding the downgrade of the ratings assigned to Gensol. The CRAs submitted that pursuant to news reports concerning default by BluSmart Mobility Private Limited (BluSmart), a related party of Gensol, on February 24, 2025, the CRAs initiated a review of the ratings assigned to the instruments of Gensol. 16. As per submissions of CRAs, Gensol responded to CRA queries by stating that it was regular in its debt servicing and that the default by BluSmart had no impact on the Company. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 4 of 29** ----- ### 17. The CRAs further submitted that when they sought term loan statements, Gensol provided the statements of all lenders except those of Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA) and Power Finance Corporation (PFC). In respect of these two lenders (PFC and IREDA), Gensol shared Conduct Letters purportedly issued by IREDA and PFC, which stated that Gensol was regular in its debt servicing. 18. CARE also submitted that Gensol requested withdrawal of the ratings assigned to it and, in support of this request, submitted a No Objection Certificate (NOC) purportedly issued by its (Gensol) lenders. 19. However, upon seeking confirmation from IREDA and PFC regarding the issuance of the Conduct Letters and NOCs, both the lenders categorically denied having issued s uc h letters .

The statements for December 2024, January 2025 and February 2025 were submitted on January 6, 2025, February 10, 2025 and March 3, 2025, respectively.

It was noted that out of Rs. 977.75 Crore availed by the Company from IREDA and PFC as term loans, Rs. 663.89 Crore was for purchasing 6,400 Electric Vehicles. As per the submissions made by Gensol, EVs were procured by the Company and subsequently leased to BluSmart, a related party. 26. Gensol, vide its response dated February 14, 2025, acknowledged that it had procured only 4,704 electric vehicles (EVs) till date, as against the 6,400 EVs for which it had secured funding. This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29. Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close relatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these diversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and thereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of **___________________________________________________________________________ **",

It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz.

Further, it was noted that Gensol Consultant transferred back funds amounting to Rs.46.65 Crore to Go-Auto, using the funds taken from Gensol EV Lease.

From the above, it is prima facie observed that funds amounting to Rs. 96.69 Crore (Rs. 46.65 Crore + Rs. 50.04 Crore), as mentioned at para 48 above, were diverted from the listed company and ultimately reached the private promoter related entities of Gensol. Further, it can be seen that Rs. 37.5 Crore out of the loan amount of Rs.171.30 Crore taken by Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd., (a subsidiary of Gensol), from IREDA was ultimately transferred to Anmol Singh Jaggi. This aspect need further examination. 54. From the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis- utilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related entities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore (including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis showed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has obtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore. 55.

    "chunk": "around Rs. 50 Crore was due from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs to Gensol. 56. In this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated April 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore as interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer. Interestingly, in the same letter, Gensol has noted that, on a consolidated basis, Gensol has a payable of Rs. 5.37 Crore to Go-Auto. 57. From the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted prima-facie that even after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs. 775 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) over and above the cost price of the 4,704 EVs that have been delivered to Gensol, the Company still had a payable of about Rs. 50 Crore to Go-Auto, as per the claim of MD of Go-Auto submitted under oath. This shortfall prima facie appears to be diversion of funds by Gensol to connected entities using Go-Auto as a conduit, which needs detailed investigation. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 17 of 29** ----- ***Diversion of funds through a connected entity, Wellray Solar Industries Pvt. Ltd.*** ### 58. As stated above, Wellray was also one of the recipients of funds out of money borrowed by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, which was routed through Go-Auto. It was further noted during the examination that Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi\u2014current promoters and directors of Gensol\u2014were also directors in Wellray until April 15, 2020. Further, up to the financial year 2019\u201320, the entire shareholding in Wellray was held by Puneet Singh Jaggi and Gensol Ventures Private Limited \u2013both promoters of Gensol. 59. Presently, almost the entire shareholding (99%) of Wellray is held by Lalit Solanki, who was employed as Regulatory Affairs Manager at the Gensol Group until December 2018, as per information available on LinkedIn. Given the same, it is prima facie observed that Wellray is connected to Gensol, both through historical promoter positions and current key managerial associations. 60. When the ledgers of Wellray in the books of Gensol were examined, it was noted that significant sales and purchases were recorded between both companies in FY 23 and FY24, the details of which are given in the Table below: |Particulars|FY 23 (Rs.

As stated in the earlier part of this Order, Wellray had utilised funds received from Gensol for trading in the Company\u2019s scrip. The details of the trades executed by Wellray for the period April 2022 to December 2024 were obtained from BSE and NSE and given in the Table below: |Period|Scrip Name|Amount in Rs.|Col4| |---|---|---|---| |||Buy Value|Sale Value| |April 2022 to December 2024|Reliance Infrastructure Limited|17,791|-| ||Shyam Metallic & Energy Limited|4,628|-| ||Tata Chemicals Limited|9,650|-| ||Tata Motors Limited|25,306|-| ||Mufin Green Finance Limited|71,23,530|15,22,963| ||Gensol Engineering Limited|160,51,05325|178,44,28,644| |Total||161,22,86,230|178,59,51,607| ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 23 of 29** ----- ### 77.

In view of the above, it is prima facie observed that Gensol and its promoters/promoter related entities have funded Wellray for trading in the scrip of Gensol which is a violation of the restrictions contained in section 67 of the Companies Act, 2013. As is also apparent from the trading in the shares of Gensol by Wellray, the latter made handsome gains from the transactions. ***Disclosures made by the Company*** ### 80. It was noted that the Company had made a disclosure dated January 28, 2025, to the exchanges that it had received pre-orders for 30,000 of its newly launched electric vehicles unveiled at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. However, when relevant documents were called for from the Company and examined it was noted that the Orders in question were Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) entered with 9 entities for 29,000 cars. The MOUs were in the nature of an expression of willingness with no reference to the price of the vehicle or delivery schedules. Therefore, it prima facie appeared that the Company was making misleading disclosures to investors. 81. In this regard, representative of NSE visited the plant site of Gensol Electric Vehicle Private Limited located at Gat No. 877, Next to Mahindra Towers, Khed, Nighoje, Chakan, Pune \u2013 410501 on April 09, 2025. 82. It was found during the visit that there was no manufacturing activity at the plant with only 2-3 labourers present there. The NSE official called for details of electricity bills of the unit and it was observed that the maximum amount billed by Mahavitaran during last 12 months was Rs. 1,57,037.01 for the month of December 2024. Hence, it can be inferred that there has been no manufacturing activity at the plant site which is on a leased property. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 25 of 29** ----- ### 83. In another disclosure dated January 16, 2025, Gensol had informed Exchanges that Gensol and Refex Green Mobility Limited (Refex) were \u201cpleased to *announce a strategic tie-up for the transfer of 2,997 electric four-wheelers * (e4Ws)\u201d to Refex . As per the said disclosure, Refex would in turn, assume Gensol\u2019s existing loan facility amounting to Rs.315 Crore. However, in a disclosure dated March 28, 2025, the proposed takeover by Refex was withdrawn. 84. Further, vide a disclosure dated February 25, 2025, Gensol informed Exchanges that Gensol had signed a non-binding term sheet for an amount of Rs. 350 Crore for a strategic transaction involving the sale of Gensol\u2019s US Subsidiary, viz., Scorpius Trackers Inc. It was noted that the said US Subsidiary was incorporated on July 22, 2024. When probed by SEBI regarding the basis of such valuation of Rs.350 Crore, Gensol has failed to submit any explanation / rationale. ***Pledge of Shares made by Promoters to IREDA*** ### 85. As mentioned in para 6 above, the shareholding of the promoters of Gensol",

We have been informed by IREDA vide email dated April 11, 2025 that promoters have created pledges for 75.74 Lakh shares of Gensol. Further, the latest pledge invocation data available on the BSE website, indicates that more pledges have been invoked during this month. This would lead to the possible conclusion that promoter shareholding in Gensol would become even lower, may be negligible, if IREDA were to invoke the pledge created by Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. **Prima facie violations found against the Noticees ** 87. In the above paragraphs, the prima facie findings have shown mis-utilization and diversion of funds of the Company in a fraudulent manner by its promoter directors, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, who are also the direct beneficiaries of the diverted funds, as has been detailed above. The Company **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 26 of 29** ----- ### has attempted to mislead SEBI, the CRAs, the lenders and the investors by submitting forged Conduct Letters purportedly issued by its lenders. In view of these prima facie findings, the Noticees 1, 2 and 3 are alleged to have violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 3(b), (c) and (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(f), (k) & (r) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. 88. Further, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the promoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of Gensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions qualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be disclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR Regulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol has allegedly failed to do. **Need for Interim Directions ** 89. What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. The result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned above would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company. 90. While the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither isolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising critical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector entities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital- **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order",

In the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the Company. 93. It must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares in the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip. At this stage, allowing this Corporate Action may not be in the interest of the investors. 94. In view of the above, pending detailed investigation, I deem it fit to issue immediate interim directions to safeguard the interests of the investors and preserve market integrity. 95. At the same time, I deem it fit to caution the investors, as done on previous occasions, to be careful while investing their savings in the capital markets. **Directions ** 96. Keeping in view the foregoing, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Sections 11, 11(4) and 11B (1) read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992, hereby issue by way of this interim order the following directions, which shall be in force until further orders: - **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 28 of 29** ----- ### (a) Noticees 2 and 3 are restrained from holding the position of a director or a Key Managerial Personnel in Gensol, until further orders.

If the said Noticees have any open position in any exchange-traded derivative contracts, as on the date of the Order, they can close out /square off such open positions within 7 days from the date of the Order or at the expiry of such contracts, whichever is earlier.

See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install 'markitdown[all]'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install 'markitdown[all]'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e 'packages/markitdown[all]' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: ``` pip install 'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]' ``` will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files. At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: * `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies *",
